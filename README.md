# Change-detection-in-optical-satellite-images-using-local-self-similarity-pattern

### _**Overview**_
This project focuses on developing a robust and efficient system for detecting changes in optical satellite images. By leveraging the concept of Local Self-Similarity Patterns (LSSP), aimed to automatically identify and highlight areas of significant change between multiple images acquired at different times.

### _**Motivation**_
Detecting changes in satellite imagery is crucial for various applications, including urban planning, environmental monitoring, disaster management, and security.
Manual change detection can be time-consuming and error-prone, making automated methods essential for analyzing large image datasets.
